        We all know how difficult it is to handle chess rage whenever we make an obvious blunder or lose by time!
        Infact, this is mostly the reason why most of the beginners quit playing chess, and that's exactly why I decided to talk about this first. Even though some of the best players of the world quite often suffer from this problem (which in most cases becomes quite obvious from their facial expressions and body language), this isn't something that we should let happen for ourselves, thinking that what works for the pros, would work for us too.
